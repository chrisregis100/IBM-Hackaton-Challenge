Personalized Learning Platform with AI

Project Overview

This platform is designed to offer a personalized learning experience using IBM Watsonx.ai to generate tailored assessment tests for users based on their chosen learning domains. The goal is to help users determine their current level of knowledge and guide them through relevant learning modules to improve their skills.

This project is developed for a hackathon using IBM Watsonx.ai and IBM Granite to showcase the potential of AI in improving productivity and learning efficiency.

Key Features

1. User Domain Selection:

Users can select from various learning domains such as Science, Technology, Arts, and more.

Each domain is linked to specific learning modules, which will be unlocked based on the user’s test results.

2. AI-Generated Level Tests:

After selecting a domain, the platform uses IBM Watsonx.ai to generate a customized test.

The test assesses the user’s knowledge and suggests learning modules accordingly.

Questions are displayed as multiple-choice options with radio buttons for easy interaction.


3. Saving Progress:

The user’s progress is saved locally (via Local Storage) so they can continue their learning journey where they left off.

Upon returning to the platform, the user is prompted to pick up their progress or restart a new test.



4. Immediate Feedback:

Once the user completes the test, they receive immediate feedback on their performance.

Based on the test results, the platform suggests appropriate learning modules or additional resources.

5. Personalized Learning Path:

The platform recommends learning modules based on the user's test results, providing a tailored learning path to improve their knowledge in specific areas.

Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for state management)

Backend: Not used (for simplicity, the content and user data are stored locally)

AI Integration: IBM Watsonx.ai for test generation

Storage: Local Storage for saving user progress


How It Works

1. Domain Selection:

Users are presented with a list of learning domains. They can choose one or more domains in which they want to assess their knowledge.



2. AI-Generated Test:

After the domain selection, the platform calls IBM Watsonx.ai to generate a test specific to the chosen domain.

The test is displayed in the form of multiple-choice questions where users can select their answers using radio buttons.



3. Answer Submission:

Users submit their answers, which are then saved locally.

The platform processes the answers to give immediate feedback.

4. Feedback and Recommendations:

Based on the user’s performance in the test, the platform provides feedback and suggests relevant learning modules for improvement.

5. Progress Saving:

The user's progress, including test results and learning modules, is saved in Local Storage to allow them to return and continue their journey.

Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/personalized-learning-platform.git
cd personalized-learning-platform


2. Install dependencies (if applicable):

npm install


3. Run the application:

npm start

4. Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
Usage Guide

1. Selecting a Learning Domain:

On the homepage, the user is presented with a list of learning domains.

The user selects one or more domains they wish to be tested on.



2. Taking the AI-Generated Test:

Once the domain is selected, the user is presented with a test generated by IBM Watsonx.ai.

The test consists of multiple-choice questions, where users can select their answers using radio buttons.


3. Receiving Feedback:

After submitting the test, the user receives immediate feedback on their performance.

Based on their score, they are guided towards specific learning modules.

4. Continuing Learning:

The user’s progress is saved, allowing them to return later and continue their learning journey

Potential Improvements

Authentication: Implementing user accounts to enable cross-device progress tracking.

Backend Integration: Migrating from local storage to a database to handle large-scale user data and better track progress.

Advanced Learning Modules: Adding detailed learning content based on user progress and performance.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
